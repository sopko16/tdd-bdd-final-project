Feature: The product store service back-end
    As a Product Store Owner
    I need a RESTful catalog service
    So that I can keep track of all my products

Background:
    Given the following products
        | name       | description     | price   | available | category   |
        | Hat        | A red fedora    | 59.95   | True      | CLOTHS     |
        | Shoes      | Blue shoes      | 120.50  | False     | CLOTHS     |
        | Big Mac    | 1/4 lb burger   | 5.99    | True      | FOOD       |
        | Sheets     | Full bed sheets | 87.00   | True      | HOUSEWARES |

Scenario: The server is running
    When I visit the "Home Page"
    Then I should see "Product Catalog Administration" in the title
    And I should not see "404 Not Found"
